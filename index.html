    <h1>About My Dog!</h1>
<body>
    <p>I have been missing my dog a lot lately so I decided to dedicate my DS4200 homework to him. 
    Thai is a seven-year-old vizsla, which is a bird dog from Hungary. He is living with my parents in Seattle, Washington.
    Although I am an only child, I am familiar with parental favortism among siblings due to how much 
    more my parents love Thai over me. Honestly, I get it. He doesn't get college tuition bills in the mail, only
    eats Costco kibble, and doesn't talk back. The only thing I can one-up him on is I shed much less.
