    <h3>A day in the life of Thai Knight</h3>
</head>
<body>
    Vizslas are known to be very energetic, which definitely shows in Thai. He needs to go for a long run or walk for at least 3 hours per day.
    Every morning someone in my family will take him out to the park to run or swim in the lake, for at least an hour and a half. 
    During this time, he will find the biggest stick he can physically pick up and prance around the park, showing off his prize to passers-by. <p>

    <p>His record is an 8 foot long stick.</p>
    
    <p>After this outing, he will take one of several naps throughout the day, in one of his several dog beds, my bed,
        my parents' bed, the couch, on top of one of us, or anywhere else he can find.

    <p>After his nap, he'll do one of the following:
        <ul><li>Bark at the neighbors</li>
            <li>Bark at the air</li>
            <li>Bark at us until we play with him</li>
            <li>Eat anything he can find</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
<p>One special thing that Thai will often do is eat absolutely anything in sight. Thai is quite a big dog,
    he's 70 pounds and is about 5 feet tall when standing on his hind legs. Therefore, he can jump on top of 
    most of the high surfaces in our house, especially those where we store food. He's eaten entire sticks of butter,
    whole chicken dishes, even two full trays of brownies I meant to deliver to my friend. He was fine though, he has
    so much body mass that it would take a lot of chocolate to hurt him.

<p> After his nap and whatever snack he finds on the counter, we will go on another hour and a half long walk,
    and then come home and reminisce on photos of him as a puppy.

<p>After another long, hard day, promptly at 9pm he will crawl into bed and lay his head on the pillow like a human, despite his multitude of dog beds strewn around the house.</p>
